I type at least ~70h on different Keyboards every week and in the last years I had used over 25 different ones. In this post I want to share my favorits for each situation and some tipps.

## My Keyboard recommendations

### 1. _„HomeOffice“:_

**[Filco Majestouch Convertible 2 TKL](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/list.php?s[]=100:1001:0&s[]=120:1014:0)** + **[Majestouch TenKeyPad 2 Professional](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=3240)** + Palm-Rest

=> Best mechanical TKL/80% + Numpad Combo (ISO-DE)

### 2. _„Special Motivation“ :_

> ➖ Mobility in terms of hight  
> ➖ Missing keys - available on the second virtual layer  
> ➖ Availability - until today you can only import it from Japan

### 3. _„Office“ :_

### Mechanical Keyboard I would like to test

- [REALFORCE R2 PFU Limited Edition Silent TKL](https://www.realforcekeyboards.com)
- [Caps-Unlocked CU80](https://caps-unlocked.com/group-buy-cu80-round-2/)
- [Code V3 TKL](https://codekeyboards.com) (WASD Keyboards)
- [Keystone Analog Tactile Mechanical Keyboard](https://kono.store/products/keystone-analog-mechanical-keyboard)
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com)

(* MacOS compatibility - Use [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org) to [fix layout](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/#german_pc_shortcuts) issues or improve it.)

## Palm rest

I can highly recommend to use a matching hight palm rest for adjusting the angle of your wrist to every keyboard. 

## Spring vs Rubber

If you really need or like to be silent or you like a really short/soft key-travel go for Rubber, otherwise I would always recommend a Spring based Key-Switches. With MX-Brown or equivalent you will never make a bad choice. I love those Topre Switches in terms of sound and their nice smooth and balanced key-travel, but they are only available in a few expensive Keyboards.The worst choice in opinion is a Rubber Key-Switch with long key-travel.

## Upcoming evolutions

- [Low profile mechanical switches](https://www.kailhswitch.com/mechanical-keyboard-switches/low-profile-key-switches/) like the [FILCO Majestouch Stingray](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/Stingray/)
- [Beam-Spring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFYoh5VcZvg) with [Hall-Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hall_Sensor.webm) sense Key-Switches like the upcomming [Silo Beam](https://kono.store/blogs/keyboards/silo-beam) („AI“ typing correction, gas pedal like key press levels)

## Recommendations

### Take care of your Keyboard

Don’t eat & type and wash your hands.
Clean your Keyboard at least every 40h of usage or more often - I use a vacuum cleaner and a microfibre cloth with 70% isopropyl alcohol on it.
Use a cloth or a cover to protect your keyboard from dust. In terms of mechanical keyboards, you can also disassemble the keys to clean everything if needed.

### Buy the right one

Buy a Keyboard that match the most of your requirements. Buy no garbage and with a plan to use it long term. Don’t buy more Keyboards as devices you own. Don't buy a ANSI layout version only because of a not available ISO version (or vice versa) if you don't want to switch the layout your muscle memory is trained to.
