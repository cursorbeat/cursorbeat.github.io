The cursor beats and running letters mark down the line in the [text.app](https://marktext.app) for this [static.site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) powerd Blog.

In the first steps everything here will be about Apps/Tools, Software-Development, DevOps and some storys worth to be told around those topics.

I try to ceep everything as short as possible to be able to read everything quickly, not wasting time.

To be introduced: My name is Adrian Grimm I'm a german Software-Developer and currently the only one who pushes the cursor beating around here.

Blog Design and used technologys could change over time but as for now this will work - hostet on [Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com) deployed by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com) - so this is atm the DevOps style to blog.
If you want to take a look into the Code behind this - everything will be and stay opensource on [Github](https://github.com/cursorbeat/cursorbeat.github.io).

It's done! : [CursorBeat.dev Blog](https://blog.cursorbeat.dev) is online :tada: - cursor beats - waiting for more key pressed - instructing to move on - leaving signs behind...
