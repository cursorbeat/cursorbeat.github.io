On Windows there is the <a href=\"https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\">PowerShell 7</a> - but like nearly every other shell, the base config is not as usefull for development tasks as it could be. This post gives some ideas of how the UI/UX could get improved for those tasks.</p>\n<h2>Terminal</h2>\n<p>First of all the old CMD.exe should get retired on your Windows system! I could realy recommend the new <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/terminal\">Windows Terminal</a> - even though it's in preview state. The newest version recieved one of my last missing features - the mouse support for visual input - now it has nearly all needed features to be a powerfull terminal for PowerShell, WSL and SSH use-cases. But you can use PowerShell 7 and this config also on MacOS and Linux if you want (makes sense in terms of e.g. Dot.Net-Core development, Azure Cloud config,...).</p>\n<p>On MacOS I could recommend <a href=\"https://iterm2.com\">iTerm 2</a> on Linux <a href=\"https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/\">Tilix</a> and as Cross-Platform solution with some performance trade-offs <a href=\"https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/\">Terminus</a>.</p>\n<h2>Shell customizing</h2>\n<p>I use Git all the way for version control of my code, snippets, scripts, notes and documentation. My main Git tool is always a commandline Git. Because of that I like to see the Git status always present in the promt of the main shell I use. On Z-Shell and PowerShell exists well implemented PowerLine themes to present those informations in a clean way. To get this style and also the for me important auto-suggest and history-search feature I installed some modules and customised the PowerShell profile.</p>\n<h2>PowerShell Configuration</h2>\n<h3>Modules</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of infrastructure extensions to customize shell's to be able to easy install packages which extend or modify the look of your shell. For Fish-Shell \"<a href=\"https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish\">Oh-My-Fish</a>\", for Z-Shell \"<a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh\">Oh-My-Zsh</a>\" and this Oh-My-Sh** continues with \"<a href=\"https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh\">Oh-My-Posh</a>\" for PowerShell.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"powershell\"><pre class=\"language-powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\">Install<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Module <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Name oh<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>my<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>posh\nInstall<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Module <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Name posh<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>git <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>AllowPrerelease</code></pre></div>\n<p>For additional module packages take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages\">Gallery</a>.<br>\nThere is also a upcomming <a href=\"http://pecigonzalo.github.io/Oh-My-Posh/\">second \"Oh-My-Posh\"</a>.</p>\n<h3>PowerShell $Profile config</h3>\n<p>To create use <code class=\"language-text\">PowerShell</code>New-Item -path $Profile -type file –force<code class=\"language-text\"></code>.<br>\nYou can edit your profile config with e.g. <code class=\"language-text\">notepad $PROFILE</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"powershell\"><pre class=\"language-powershell\"><code class=\"language-powershell\"><span class=\"token function\">Set</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>PSReadlineKeyHandler <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Key Tab <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token keyword\">Function</span> MenuComplete\n<span class=\"token function\">Set</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>PSReadlineKeyHandler <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Key UpArrow <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token keyword\">Function</span> HistorySearchBackward\n<span class=\"token function\">Set</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>PSReadlineKeyHandler <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Key DownArrow <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token keyword\">Function</span> HistorySearchForward\n<span class=\"token function\">Set</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>PSReadlineOption <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>ShowToolTips <span class=\"token operator\">-</span>BellStyle Visual\n\n<span class=\"token function\">Import-Module</span> posh<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>git\n<span class=\"token function\">Import-Module</span> oh<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>my<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>posh\n<span class=\"token function\">Set</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>Theme Paradox</code></pre></div>\n<p>May you get an error like <code class=\"language-text\">PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded. ...PowerShell_profile.ps1 is not digitally signed.</code> if so, you should run <code class=\"language-text\">Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</code> - This will allow to run any script on the local machine, that has not come from the internet.</p>\n<h3>PowerLine</h3>\n<p>For PowerLine support consistent to this setup I could recomend the PowerLine enabled version of the Microsoft Cascadia font \"<a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code\">Cascadia Mono PL</a>\" configured in your terminal.</p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"slug":"PowerShell-Config-for-Developers","title":"PowerShell Config for Developers","date":"2020-03-19T00:00:00-07:00","liveLink":null,"repo":null,"type":"blogPost"}}},{"node":{"id":"5044d927-68e5-50ff-b7bf-716d164cd850","excerpt":"I like all major Operating-Systems for different reasons and tasks.

But for me there is only one perfect shell: \"Zsh\". The <a href=\"http://zsh.sourceforge.net\">Z-shell</a> is for me the right mix of a stable, extendable, modern and universal shell. On MacOS it's already the new default shell and on Linux it's easy to install. On Windows it's also no problem, but to get it working with same smooth expirience like on Linux or MacOS, I use some tools chained together.</p>\n<p>To be clear: Yes, Microsoft has a mighty PowerShell, CMD and Git-Bash is also available for Windows. But in my humble opinion - nothing beats a zsh with the power of linux/unix commandline tool repository.</p>\n<h2>WSL Tuning</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/about\">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> is a great Feature that came with Windows 10. I think every DevOp who is working with more than only Microsoft based Operating-Systems should get firm with it.</p>\n<p>If you run WSL, the first decission is which Linux distribution you want to run. All the big ones are available (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.). My choice was <a href=\"https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com\">Pengwin</a> - it's based on Debian, but it's customised for the use with WSL.</p>\n<p>I installed ZSH and <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh\">OhMyZSH</a> together with a bunch of plugins to achieve a faster input expirience and a better visualization of context.</p>\n<p>Visualization and UI/UX in general could be a pain on a terminal. Not every terminal is capeable to render the shell output as it intendet to be or handle all keyboard and mouse input right - and yes mouse input support could be great with TMux, NVim, EMacs or other commandline tools. Regarding the UI you can <a href=\"https://terminal.sexy/\">customize colors</a> and fonts as you want, also in terms of syntax highlighting. The defaults are always reduced to a basic configuration. In my case I like to use <a href=\"https://www.nerdfonts.com\">Nerd Fonts</a> and a special <a href=\"https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k\">shell promt</a> that relies on the usage of PowerLine, Lingatures and other font features like icons etc.</p>\n<h2>Tilix</h2>\n<p>On MacOS I would always recomend <a href=\"https://iterm2.com\">iTerm2</a>, but for Linux I like <a href=\"https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/\">Tilix</a>. Tilix is a feature rich and fast terminal which does not need a lot of resources to run, but on Windows it isn't available. The default on Windows 10 is still the ugly CMD or as alternative the PowerShell - both terminals are OK if you only require to input/output some letters or run a script, but it's not enjoyable to work with beyond that.</p>\n<p>The best Windows native terminal is the new <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal\">Windows Terminal</a> from Microsoft - it's still in development - maybe there is a first stable release in April 2020 available. But until now it still has a lot of missing features.</p>\n<p>The next best terminal running on Windows IMHO is <a href=\"https://eugeny.github.io/terminus/\">Terminus</a>, but it's a heavy <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org\">ElectronJS</a> based terminal which needs a lot of resources to run.</p>\n<p>The good thing is that it is possible to run Tilix on Windows through WSL and it's not as tricky as it sounds like. You only need the X11 stack and a X Server for Windows. This sounds like a lot of overhead but it realy isn't the case.</p>\n<p>As X Window System<a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System\">(X11)</a> I can highly recomend <a href=\"https://token2shell.com/x410/\">X410</a> from Choung Networks - it's a fast reliable light weight implementation of X11 for Windows 10.</p>\n<p>I use a little trick to hide a default terminal session window in the background through a <a href=\"https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki\">TMux</a>-Server to show up Tilix. To achive this you only need a link in Windows with this command:</p>\n<p> <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe -d WLinux -- tmux -c &quot;zsh ~/Tilix_WSL-Launcher.zsh&quot;</code></p>\n<p>And in the WSL instance (here WLinux) you only need to place a <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adrian-Grimm/DotFiles/master/Tilix_WSL-Launcher.zsh\">shell script</a> which will start X410 and Tilix in Windows with no visible startup console:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\"><span class=\"token comment\">#bin! zsh</span>\nPowershell.exe -Command <span class=\"token string\">'start X410.exe /WM'</span>\ntmux new-session -s <span class=\"token string\">\"Tilix\"</span> -n <span class=\"token string\">\"Console\"</span> -d<span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>\ntmux send-keys -t Tilix <span class=\"token string\">\"Display=:0 dbus-launch --exit-with-session tilix&amp;\"</span> C-m</code></pre></div>\n<p>Take a look for a nice icon for the Windows link assigned in the properties of it and you are done. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I use this setup <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdiGrimm/status/1154045308856258561\">since a couple of month</a> and I did't got any issue at all with it. No Bugs no performance issues. Most of the time I'm using Git, <a href=\"https://spacevim.org\">SpaceVim</a>/<a href=\"https://neovim.io\">NeoVim</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki\">TMux</a>, SSH and other tools - and I'm happy with it (maybe I write another blog post about command-line-Tools, but you can get some inspiration from <a href=\"https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-command-line-apps\">this awesome collection</a>).</p>\n<p>If you like to use my configurations feel free to copy my <a href=\"https://github.com/Adrian-Grimm/DotFiles\">DotFiles repository on GitHub</a> - but don't blame me for some more dirty hacks in there :wink:. You can also clone it with <a href=\"https://yadm.io\">YADM</a> - a DotFiles Manager I could recoment.</p>","timeToRead":4,"frontmatter":{"slug":"Tilix-and-Zsh-on-Windows10","title":"Tilix and Zsh on Windows 10","date":"2020-02-01T00:00:00-07:00","liveLink":null,"repo":null,"type":"blogPost"}}},{"node":{"id":"c1dd91da-3cdd-57bf-aeb8-6cf3d18130ca","excerpt":"The cursor beats and running letters mark down the line in the text.app for this static.site powerd Blog.
